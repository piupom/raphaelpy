This directory contains source codes to create html dcumentation using Sphinx

[conf.py](conf.py) and [index.rst](index.rst) are files used by Sphinx,
[createdoc.sh](createdoc.sh) is a shell script to build the documentation.

Only public API is (should be :-) documented this way, the rest is documented in the source code.
